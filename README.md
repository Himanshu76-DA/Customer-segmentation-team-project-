## 🧩 Project Overview  

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis**, supported by **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data cleaning**.  
The goal is to identify valuable customer groups, analyze their purchasing patterns, and extract actionable business insights to improve customer retention and marketing strategies.

## 🔹 Data Cleaning  
**Performed by:** [Siddhesh](https://github.com/siddheshDA)  

### 🧼 Key Steps:
- Handled missing and null values  
- Removed duplicates and fixed incorrect data types  
- Created new features such as **Order Date**, **Order Time**, **Approval Date & Time**, and **Delivered Date & Time**  
- Produced a clean dataset ready for EDA and clustering

## 🔹 RFM Clustering  
**Performed by:** [me](https://github.com/Himanshu76-DA)  

### ⚙️ Key Tasks:
- Segmented customers using **RFM Analysis** to measure engagement  
- Clustered customers into actionable groups using **K-Means Clustering**  
- Visualized results in **2D and 3D plots**  
- Created RFM and RFM_stats summary tables and exported results for further use  

**📂 Files:**  
- [RFM Table](https://github.com/Himanshu76-DA/Customer-segmentation-team-project-/blob/main/RFM_Olis_cust_data.csv)  
- [RFM Summary Stats](https://github.com/Himanshu76-DA/Customer-segmentation-team-project-/blob/main/RFM_stats_data.csv)  
- [Notebook](https://github.com/Himanshu76-DA/Customer-segmentation-team-project-/blob/main/Olis_Dataset_jup.ipynb)

### 💡 Key Insights:
1. **High-Value Customers (665)** → Contribute ~15% of total revenue, avg monetary = ₹670  
2. **Inactive Customers (400)** → Total monetary = ₹10L, avg = ₹26  
3. **Loyal Customers (352)** → Purchase **2.17× more frequently**, ideal for loyalty campaigns  
4. **Super Frequent Buyer (1 record)** → 21 purchases — likely an outlier/test account
